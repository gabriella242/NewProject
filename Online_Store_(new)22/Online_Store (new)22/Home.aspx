            <h1>How to Choose a Telescope for Beginners</h1>
            <article>
                <p>
                    This is an exciting time to become an amateur astronomer. Never have novice stargazers been presented with such a vast array of telescopes and accessories to pursue their hobby. 
                                Naturally, this brings the burden of choice: the bewildering variety makes it hard for an uninformed consumer to make the right decision on what type of telescope to buy.
                                Whether you're seriously considering buying your first telescope or just daydreaming about it, this guide will help you narrow your options. First we'll explore the types of telescopes available, 
                                and then we'll discuss their key features — the size of the primary lens or mirror, type of mount, portability, computerization, and accessories. 
                                We'll also look at the tradeoffs, because every instrument has its advantages and disadvantages.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Before you buy anything, you must determine what's important to you. What do you most want to look at? 
                                How dark is your sky? How experienced an observer are you? How much to you want to spend? What storage space do you have, and how much weight do you want to carry?
                                Answer these key questions, familiarize yourself with what's on the market, and you'll be well on your way to choosing a telescope that will satisfy you for many years to come.
                                Before examining the different telescopes available, it's worth knowing the basics of how they work.
                            
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    The most important aspect of any telescope is its aperture, the diameter of its main optical component, which can be either a lens or a mirror.
                                A scope's aperture determines both its light-gathering ability (how bright the image appears) and its resolving power (how sharp the image appears).
                                When learning how to choose a telescope, knowing all you can about the aperture is crucial to your ability to see the night sky.
                                What does this mean? The bigger the aperture the better. With a 6-inch telescope you can discern craters on the Moon as small as about a mile across — half
                                the size of those visible in a 3-inch scope (under the same conditions using the same magnification). The same two instruments turned toward a faint galaxy on a moonless night
                                would tell an even more dramatic story. Because the surface area of a 6-inch mirror is four times that of a 3-inch mirror, it collects four times as much light,
                                meaning the galaxy would appear four times brighter. (Astronomically speaking, that's 1.5 magnitudes brighter.)

                <h2>Types of Telescopes: The Best of Both Worlds</h2>
                <p>
                    Then there's the third type of telescope, the catadioptric or compound telescope. These were invented in the 1930s out of a desire to marry the best characteristics of refractors and reflectors: 
                                they employ both lenses and mirrors to form an image. The greatest appeal of these instruments is that, in their commonly encountered forms (the Schmidt-Cassegrain and Maksutov-Cassegrain), 
                                they are very compact. Their tubes are just two to three times as long as wide, an arrangement allowed by "optical folding" of the light. The smaller tube can use a lighter and thus more manageable mounting.
                                The upshot is that you can obtain a large-aperture, long-focus telescope that's very transportable.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    But here too there are caveats. Like the Newtonian, the Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope needs occasional optical collimation that lessens its appeal to those disinclined to tinker.
                                Their fields of view can be rather narrow, too. In terms of cost, aperture for aperture, the catadioptric lies midway between the reflector and the refractor.
                                Like a Newtonian, the popular forms of compound telescopes have a secondary mirror in the light path of the instrument, and this slightly degrades performance for critical lunar and planetary observations.
                                Even so, when well made, a Schmidt-Cassegrain or Maksutov will deliver very fine images of a wide variety of celestial objects.
                                
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    In common with refractors, the tubes of catadioptrics are sealed so that dirt and dust are largely excluded — a big plus for an instrument that you're going to take out into the country.
                                But if you live in an area where dew occurs (which is almost everywhere), some sort of collar or extension to prevent misting of the exposed corrector plate at the front of the tube is a must.
